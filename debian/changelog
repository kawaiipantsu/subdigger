subdigger (1.2.6-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * CRITICAL: Implemented hard wall-clock timeout for DNS resolutions
  * Each dns_resolve_full() call has a hard limit of (timeout * 2) seconds
  * Timeout checks before and after each DNS query type
  * Forcibly cancels all pending queries if hard timeout exceeded
  * wait_for_query() uses smaller intervals (50ms/250ms) for faster response
  * Maximum iteration limit prevents infinite loops
  * Prevents threads from hanging indefinitely on stuck DNS queries
  * Ensures all worker threads make progress even with problematic servers
